## Replacement details

### Replaces: smite evil

- **Archetype feature:** Stigmata
- **Description:** As a standard action, the martyr can chant hymns of faith and cause bleeding stigmata to visibly appear on his body; at 7th level, he can manifest stigmata as a move action, and at 13th level, he can do so as a swift action.
- **Mechanics:**
  - Level hooks: 7, 13, 1, 10, 16.
  - Mechanics summary: As a standard action, the martyr can chant hymns of faith and cause bleeding stigmata to visibly appear on his body; at 7th level, he can manifest stigmata as a move action, and at 13th level, he can do so as a swift action. He can use this ability a number of rounds per day equal to 4 + his Charisma modifier at 1st level, plus 1 additional round per day for each level beyond 1st. While his stigmata are active, he takes 1 point of bleed damage, which automatically ceases when he ends this ability but otherwise does not relent, even in the face of magical healing or Heal checks. His stigmata assist his allies, duplicating the effect of the countersong, distraction, or inspire courage bardic performance of a bard of his paladin level, though both countersong and distraction use Heal skill checks instead of Perform skill checks. At 10th level, he can choose to duplicate the effects of inspire greatness. At 16th level, he can choose to duplicate the effects of inspire heroics.

  - Level hooks: 2.
  - Mechanics summary: At 2nd level, the martyr and all allies within 20 feet of him gain a +4 morale bonus on saving throws against bardic performance, sonic effects, language-dependent effects, and gaze attacks. This ability functions only when the martyr is conscious.

### Alters: aura of courage, aura of resolve
- **Archetype feature:** Aura Mastery (Su)

- **Mechanics:**
  - Type: Su.

### Replaces: divine health

### Alters: lay on hands and mercy

- **Archetype feature:** Martyr's Mercy (Su)
- **Description:** At 3rd level, a martyr can apply any of the mercies for which he qualifies based on his paladin level to his lay on hands, even if he didn’t select that mercy (or its prerequisites).
- **Mechanics:**
  - Type: Su.
  - Level hooks: 3.
  - Mechanics summary: At 3rd level, a martyr can apply any of the mercies for which he qualifies based on his paladin level to his lay on hands, even if he didn’t select that mercy (or its prerequisites). However, when he uses a mercy he didn’t select, he transfers the condition to himself for the remaining duration (ignoring any immunity he might have to the condition), and he can’t use this ability if he already has that condition. If he transfers a condition to himself in this way, he can’t remove it from himself with a personalonly ability. The martyr can use lay on hands on any ally within 30 feet, rather than needing to touch the ally, but using lay on hands on himself is a standard action, not a swift action.
- **Implementation flags:**
  - Likely existing hooks: paladin mercy hook.

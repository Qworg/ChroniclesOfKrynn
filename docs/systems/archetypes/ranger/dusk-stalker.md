## Replacement details

- **Mechanics:**
  - Level hooks: 3.
  - Mechanics summary: When a dusk stalker gains the favored terrain ability, that ability is modified in the following ways. At 3rd level, a dusk stalker picks his primary terrain normally, but only gains a +1 bonus on those checks while on a plane other than the Shadow Plane, and gains a +3 bonus on those checks while on the Shadow Plane. Each time he chooses to add a bonus in a favored terrain, he gains a +1 bonus on those checks while on a plane other than the Shadow Plane, and gains a +3 bonus on those checks while on the Shadow Plane.
- **Implementation flags:**
  - Likely existing hooks: typed/untyped numeric bonus, favored terrain hook.

### Replaces: hunter’s bond

- **Archetype feature:** Shadow Bond (Su)
- **Description:** At 4th level, a dusk stalker creates a mystical bond with shadows.
- **Mechanics:**
  - Type: Su.
  - Level hooks: 4.
  - Mechanics summary: At 4th level, a dusk stalker creates a mystical bond with shadows. The shadows around a dusk stalker weave and swirl, confusing his enemies. When a dusk stalker is fighting in dim light or darkness (magical or otherwise), he gains a +4 insight bonus on Acrobatics checks made to move through an enemy’s threatened area or through its space. Furthermore, a number of times per day equal to his Wisdom modifier, the dusk stalker can manipulate shadows in a 5-foot square within 30 feet. That square must be in an area of dim light or darkness (magical or otherwise). Enemies with an Intelligence score within or adjacent to that 5-foot square take a –2 penalty to AC and on Reflex saving throws.
- **Implementation flags:**
  - Likely existing hooks: typed/untyped numeric bonus, numeric penalty.

### Replaces: camouflage

- **Archetype feature:** Dark Sight (Su)
- **Description:** At 12th level, a dusk stalker gains the see in darkness ability.
- **Mechanics:**
  - Type: Su.
  - Level hooks: 12.
  - Mechanics summary: At 12th level, a dusk stalker gains the see in darkness ability.
- **Implementation flags:**
  - No obvious unsupported subsystem detected from the parsed mechanics; still map feature keys and verify behavior against current class systems.
